## How Install :bookmark_tabs:
```
# Create folder for store the files, like 'GeneralDetection'

IMPORTANT!
Cascades (Haar Cascade) is a XML file trained with positives and negatives images to fast
detection of objects, body parts and whatever. Method created by Paul Viola and Michael Jones

# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/BieAnimaton/Image-Detection

# Install the dependencies
pip install opencv-python or install from IDE (PyCharm for example).

Use  "cascades" folder to set your cascade XML from detection. 
Use "pessoas" or "others" to select a image to start the detection.

# To start
python "video detection.py" 
   or
python [others .py files]

# The project messages will appear on console
```

## Features :hammer_and_wrench:
